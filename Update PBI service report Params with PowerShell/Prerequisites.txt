Prerequisites:


Register an Azure AD Application:

- Obtain the Tenant ID and Client ID.
- Generate a client secret if necessary.

Assign API Permissions:

- Grant the app appropriate permissions to the Power BI API.
- Grant admin consent for the permissions.

Configure Power BI Settings:

- Enable service principal access in the Power BI Admin Portal if using service principal authentication.
- Ensure the app or user has the necessary workspace and dataset permissions.

Key Notes:
Pro License Compatibility: Yes, this API approach works with a Pro license, provided you authenticate as a user with appropriate access.
Delegated Permissions: Since there’s no Premium Capacity, you’ll need to use delegated permissions (authenticate as a user) rather than service principal (application permissions).
